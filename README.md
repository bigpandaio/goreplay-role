## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install the [go replay](https://goreplay.org/) utility as a service in your Debian system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.2.0.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver (with [landrush](https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush) plugin) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```
- src: http://github.com/idealista-tech/gor-role.git
  scm: git
  version: 0.0.3
  name: gor
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - { role: gor,
        gor_input: '--input-raw :80',
        gor_output: '--output-http=http://test01:80',
        gor_service_enabled: yes
      }
```

## Usage

To enable gor and replicate traffic on another host

```
gor_input: --input-raw :80
gor_output: --output-http=http://test01:80
gor_service_enabled: yes
```

To save it to a file

```
gor_input: --input-raw :80
gor_output: "--output-file={{ gor_output_dir }}/requests.gor"
gor_service_enabled: yes
```

!Stop gor to retrieve the file, otherwise you could lost last requests https://github.com/buger/gor/wiki/Saving-and-Replaying-from-file#buffered-file-output

```
gor_service_state: stopped
```

Or stop the service manually

```
ssh user@host
sudo service gor stop
```

Or start the service with a low flush interval

```
gor_input: --input-raw :80
gor_output: "--output-file={{ gor_output_dir }}/requests.gor"
gor_service_enabled: yes
gor_options:
  - output-file-flush-interval 0m1s
```
